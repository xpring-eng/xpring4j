## About This Library

<img src="architecture.png" alt="Architecture Diagram of Xpring SDK"/>

Xpring4J is a Java library that is shipped as a consumable artifact in Maven Central..

This library relies depends on both:

- [Xpring Common JS](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-common-js): Common code shared across Xpring SDK in JavaScript.
- [Xpring Common Protocol Buffers](http://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring-common-protocol-buffers): Common protocol buffers shared across Xpring SDK.

## Requirements for a Successful Pull Request

Before being considered for review or merging, each pull request must:

- Pass continuous integration tests.
- Update documentation for any new features.
- Be free of lint errors. Please run `checkstyle` before sending a pull request.
- Be [marked as drafts](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) until they are ready for review.
- Adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this repository.

## Building The Library

The protocol buffer compiler (protoc) needs to be installed in order to generate protobufs.
```shell
# Install Protocol Buffer Compiler

# OSX
$ brew install protobuf

# Linux
$ sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

# Otherwise, see: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation
```

The library should build and pass all tests. 

```shell
# Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/xpring-eng/xpring4j.git
$ cd xpring4j

# Update submodules
$ git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run tests.
$ mvn clean test
```

Lint rules are enforced on all continuous integration builds via 
[CheckStyle](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/). It is recommended developers use the 
[IntelliJ CheckStyle Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea) to lint their code during
development.
