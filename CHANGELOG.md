## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- `XpringClient` is removed from XpringKit. This class has been deprecated since 1.5.0. Clients should use `XRPClient` instead.

## Changed
- `XRPClient` now uses [rippled's protocol buffer API](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3254) rather than the legacy API. Users who wish to use the legacy API should pass `false` for `useNewProtocolBuffers` in the constructor.

## 2.2.0 - March 6, 2020

This release contains new functionality for InterLedger Protocol (ILP) in the `ILPClient` class. 

This release also deprecates `XpringClient` and creates a new class called `XRPClient` with the same API. Clients should move to using `XRPClient` at their convenience. 

### Added
- `XRPClient` is a renamed version of XpringClient to better clarify the class's role in the SDK
- `ILPClient` is a new class for interacting with the ILP Network.

### Deprecated
- The `XpringClient` class is deprecated. Please use `XRPClient` instead.

## 2.1.0 - Feb 28, 2020

This version uses new protocol buffers from rippled which have breaking changes in them. Specifically, the breaking changes include:
- Re-ordering and repurposing of fields in order to add additional layers of abstraction
- Change package from `rpc.v1` to `org.xrpl.rpc.v1`

This change is transparent to public API users. However, clients will need to connect to a rippled node which is built at any commit after [#3254](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3254).

## Version 2.0.0 - Feb 24, 2020

### rippled Support

This release adds support for the new rippled protocol buffers and adds browser compatibility support.

New Protocol Buffers from rippled
rippled implemented protocol buffer support natively, which uses a new and incompatible set of protocol buffers. The implementation in rippled was completed in: ripple/rippled#3159. Xpring4j is now capable of using these protocol buffers. This change is opt-in and non-breaking.

To switch to these protocol buffers, pass true to the useNewProtocolBuffer parameter in XpringClient's constructor. The default for this field is false. The remote rippled node must have gRPC enabled.

### Additional Fixes

This release contains some breaking changes that fix and productionize this library. In particular, users will now have to provide a URL for a remote gRPC node when using `XpringClient`. Clients can use `grpc.xpring.tech:80` if they wish to use Xpring's hosted TestNet service. 

Additionally, exceptions were mistakenly named `XpringKitException`, which was a reference to the Swift variant of this library. This is a simple rename, no functionality is added, changed or removed.

#### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `XpringKitException` to `XpringException`. XpringKit is the name of the Swift flavor of the Xpring SDK.
- Require a gRPC parameter in XpringClient's initializer. A default value is no longer provided.
